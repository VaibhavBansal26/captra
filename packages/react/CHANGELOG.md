# @captra-ai/react

## 0.4.1

### Patch Changes

- Add package-specific npm READMEs with installation, usage, security notes, documentation links, and repository links. Package and public-release checks now fail when README content is missing.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Harden execution with independent approver identities, requester self-approval denial, per-run cancellation, compare-and-set terminal transitions, and durable effect receipts for side-effect-safe retries.

  Write tools can now declare `effect: 'write'` with a stable `idempotencyKey`. Completed effects are reused and ambiguous effects stop with `EffectInDoubtError` instead of being replayed.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Add Captra State, a typed reactive state graph with subscriptions, request deduplication, prefix invalidation, optimistic updates, rollback, persistence, and hydration. Capabilities can now declare state reads, writes, and invalidations; local and remote React hooks apply those effects after successful execution.
